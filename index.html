                        <div>I am a highly enthusiastic, hard-working and detail-oriented software developer. I’m always eager to learn and enjoy problem solving. I have a track record of delivering high quality software on time and to specification, using industry practices and standards throughout.</div>

                            <div>
                                <li>Working as part of a team developing and supporting a regulatory system which handles the reporting of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives to a Global Trade Repository (GTR), which is critical to the banks legal obligations to report trade data. The system processes involved trade validation, enrichment, and computing to which regulatory bodies are reportable.</li>
                                <li>On a day-to-day basis, I liaise closely with business stakeholders working on business and regulatory driven requirements, as well as working to identify areas to refactor to improve performance and maintainability.</li>
                                <li>Current project involves working alongside another developer to create a central trade repository for all OTC derivative trades booked within the bank, allowing downstream consumers to subscribe to receive subsets of trade data. This involves several technical challenges, showing how I can adapt and learn new skills while meeting project requirements.</li>
                                <li>I work to very tight deadlines on a daily basis, in a high pressure environment, with potential significant financial and reputational implications to the bank. This requires consistent attention to detail, flexibility and ability to think on my feet; often involving negotiating with and educating a range of business users who don’t always have an understanding of the regulatory commitments and standards, leading to positive working relationships.</li>
                                <li>Regularly hold training sessions with new developers, production support, and QA team members in order to train them on the application, its structures and technical details, proving my strong communication skills with technical and non-technical team members.</li>
                                <li>Developing using a mixture of Java, Unix (Bash) scripting, IBM UDB, Oracle, and Tibco Business Works and Tibco EMS. Projects make heavy use several enterprise integration patterns.</li>
